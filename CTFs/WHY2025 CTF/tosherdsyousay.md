# toshredsyousay â€” Writeup

**Category:** *forensics*

## Description

I bought a new shredder and I just tested it. I think it does a decent job, I made a scan of the results, what do you think?

## Solution

There was a `.pdf` file provided. This file had a photo of shredded piece of paper with data.
First, I converted this `.pdf` to `.png` to be able to edit it:

I wasn't able to move pieces physically, so I used `GIMP` to cut and move them. Some time ago I did this and got the flag:

## Description

I bought a new shredder and I just tested it. I think it does a decent job, I made a scan of the results, what do you think?

## Solution

There was a `.pdf` file provided. The file had a photo of a shredded piece of paper with data.
First, I converted the `.pdf` to `.png` for easier editing:

Since I couldn't rearrange the physically, I used `GIMP` to cut and digitally move them. After that I got the flag:

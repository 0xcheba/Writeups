# PJHACK CTF 2025

On June 8, 2025, I took part in my university’s on-site **CTF competition** in _jeopardy_ format. It was an individual event organized by the **PJCYBERITY** cybersecurity club, with support from **PJATK’s Promotion Department**, **STM Cyber**, and **HackingDept**.

There were **16 challenges** across five categories: **web**, **forensics**, **reversing**, **crypto**, and **misc**. I managed to solve two of them — one from the _web_ category and one from _forensics_. These are the ones I remember best, so I’ve included writeups for them in this repository.

I also spent some time on two _reversing_ challenges — I didn’t finish one due to time constraints and got stuck halfway through the other during analysis. I plan to return to both and solve them independently later, to sharpen my reversing skills.

In the end, I placed **4th** with **580 points**. While I wasn’t fully satisfied with my performance and felt I could have approached some tasks more effectively, it was a valuable learning experience and gave me extra motivation to keep improving — especially in reverse engineering.
